# SAAS-Based Transport Management Application

This repository contains the SAAS-Based Transport Management Application, a cloud-based solution designed to streamline operations for transportation companies. The following sections provide an overview of the application's functionalities, technical architecture, development process, and testing strategies.

## 1. Introduction

Transportation companies often face challenges in managing Bilty, Hire challenges, and Invoices. This application aims to automate these tasks and enhance operational efficiency.

## 2. System Functionalities

### Bilty Management
- **Create and manage Bilty documents**: Includes shipment details like origin, destination, goods description, consignee, and consignor information.
- **E-way bill integration**: Ensures seamless compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Hire Challen Management
- **Issue Hire Challens**: Specifies vehicle details, duration, and cost for vehicle hire.

### Invoice Management
- **Automatic invoice generation**: Based on Bilty and Hire Challen data.
- **Tax calculations and customization**: Allows for different pricing structures.

### Additional Features (Optional)
- **Driver Management**: Tracks driver details, licenses, and job assignments.
- **Fleet Management**: Monitors vehicle location, maintenance schedules, and fuel consumption.
- **Customer Management**: Manages customer information, tracks shipment history, and offers self-service options.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### Frontend Development
- **Framework**: Built using Flutter for a single codebase across Android and iOS platforms.
- **Benefits**: Reduced development time and native-like performance.

### Backend Development
- **Framework**: Developed using Spring Boot for its robust architecture.
- **Features**: Utilizes MVC pattern, dependency injection, and RESTful API development.

### Server Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Hosted on AWS EC2 instances for scalability and elasticity.
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic efficiently across multiple EC2 instances.

### Database
- **Technology**: Uses MySQL or PostgreSQL stored on AWS RDS.
- **Benefits**: Effective structured data management.

## 4. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An ERD visualizes relationships between entities like Customer, Driver, Vehicle, Bilty, Hire Challen, and Invoice. Relationships include:
- One-to-Many between Customer and Bilty/Hire Challen.
- Many-to-One between Bilty and Customer (Consignor and Consignee).
- One-to-One or Optional between Bilty and Hire Challen.
- One-to-One between Invoice and Bilty/Hire Challen.

## 5. Class Diagram

The class diagram showcases backend logic classes with attributes and methods, adhering to object-oriented design principles.

### Customer
- **Attributes**: customerID, name, address, phone, email.
- **Methods**: `getCustomerDetails()`, `updateCustomer()`.

### Driver (Optional)
- **Attributes**: driverID, name, licenseNumber, contactInfo.
- **Methods**: `getDriverDetails()`, `assignDriverToJob()`.

### Vehicle (Optional)
- **Attributes**: vehicle, registration number, model, capacity.
- **Methods**: `getVehicleDetails()`, `trackVehicleLocation()`.

### Billy
- **Attributes**: biltyID, customerID (FK), consigneeID (FK), origin, destination, goodsDescription, ewayBillNumber (Optional).
- **Methods**: `createBilty()`, `generateEwayBill()` (Optional).

### Hire Challen
- **Attributes**: challenID, customerID (FK), vehicleID (FK - Optional), startDate, endDate, cost.
- **Methods**: `createHireChallen()`, `assignVehicle()` (Optional).

### Invoice
- **Attributes**: invoiceID, biltyID (FK), challenID (FK - Optional), amount, tax details.
- **Methods**: `generateInvoice()`.

## 6. Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- **Importance**: Ensures code quality by testing individual classes and functions.
- **Framework**: JUnit for Java.

### Integration Testing
- **Description**: Tests interaction and functionality of different modules.

### System Testing
- **Outline**: Ensures the application meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Importance**: Gather feedback from potential users to refine the application before deployment.

## 7. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model

### Model
- **Chosen Model**: Agile.

### Phases
- **Planning, Requirement Analysis, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance**: Each phase will be applied to the development of the SAAS-Based Application.

## 8. Deployment and Maintenance

### Deployment Process
- **Infrastructure**: AWS with configuration management tools like Chef or Ansible.

### Maintenance Strategy
- **Bugs, Features, Security**: Regular updates to address bugs, implement new features, and ensure security.

## 9. Security Considerations

### Measures
- **Authentication and Access Control**: Implement user authentication and access control mechanisms.
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive information.
- **Secure Coding Practices**: Regular vulnerability scanning and compliance with data privacy regulations.
